# Resolving the Travelling salesmans problem using exact algorithme & go

## Motivation

Just for fun:

- to play with go and to benchmark performance using exact algorithm [Travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Exact_algorithms)
- to complexify the classic travelling salesman problem that I already did solve [here](https://github.com/damienleroux/test-go-exact-algo-travelling-salesman-problem) with multiple salesmans instead of only one.

## WIP

This repository is in progress and a proper readme will come later.
